# Reading in csv
Read in and take a look at the data in the data/Lobster_Abundance_All_Years_20210412.csv file. *Take note of values that can be considered NA (see metadata)* and *update your import line to convert those to NA values*
# Convert column names to lower snake case
# Convert the data from frequency to case format using *dplyr::uncount()* on the existing count column. What did this do? Add annotation in your code explaining *dplyr::uncount()*
```{r}
lobster_data <- read.csv(here("data","Lobster_Abundance_All_Years_20210412.csv"), na= c("0", "-99999")) %>% # '0' does not count as a value when applying uncount()
  clean_names() %>% # Convert column names to lower snake case
  uncount(count) #removed the NA values


```
